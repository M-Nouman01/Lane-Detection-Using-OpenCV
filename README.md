# Lane-Detection-Using-OpenCV
This project demonstrates a simple lane detection system using Python and OpenCV. The system processes video frames to detect road lanes in real time. It uses Canny edge detection, region-of-interest masking, and Hough Line Transform to identify lane lines and display them on the video.
